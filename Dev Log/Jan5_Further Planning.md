# WORK IN PROGRESS

### To-do from last entry
- Model camera in Fusion 360
	- Completed with measurements from actual camera (website was slightly off)
- Get measurements for all parts
	- Measurements for XIAO, RGBW 5050 LED acquired
- Decide size confinements
	- PCB 5035mm (could be expanded if needed to fit XIAO or other components)

### Updated BOM (Changes in **bold**, funding needed in _italics_)
- **1 \* Li-ion 14500 Battery**
- **30 \* RGBW 5050 LED**
- **1 \* RP2040 SuperMini** (Changed from XIAO RP2040 as it is cheaper and has more pins)
- **2 \* 14-20 Heat Set Inserts**
- _4 \* Logic Level MOSFETS (2V, 2A)_
- _1 \* 1W 5.66.8Ω Resistor_
- _2 \* 0.5W 3Ω Resistor_
- _1 \* 0.5W 2.42.7Ω Resistor_
- _1 \* EC11 Rotary Encoder_

### Next Steps
- Find specific MOSFETS
- Circuit protection for Li-ion Battery
- Wire schematic

I began my initial planning by asking what question I want to solve: _how do I take videos with my Ixus 185 in dark rooms, given the internal flash doesn't work?_
My answer was: _an external light_

### I wanted to create something that would fulfil the below requirements: 
- run off a single AA battery (14500) or two AAA (10440)
- be able to light the scene at around arms length 
- be able to run for at least 90 mins on one single charge
- use rechargeable batteries (preferably with built in USB-C Port, examples linked [here](https://thepihut.com/products/1800mah-li-ion-rechargeable-aa-batteries-4-pack?srsltid=AfmBOorWViasMIs3Y9U_FadrwNKMZ9wtNnmldKJZbgpXu-bezA8no1r7))
- built on a frame that can have interchangeable modules
- attached to the camera via only the tripod mount (1/4"-20 Screw)
- use RGBW Lights
	- I don't need individual colour control 
	- **W** makes the whites more realistic and better on video
- run off a XIAO RP2040 - I am familiar with it from the Hackpad project and it is cheap in China

### Basic BOM
- SMD 5050 RGBW
- XIAO RP2040
- 1/4-20 5H8W Heat Set Inserts
- 1/4-20 Metal D-Ring
- 14500 Li-ion Battery

### Next Steps
- Model camera in Fusion 360
- Get measurements for all parts
- Decide size confinements
